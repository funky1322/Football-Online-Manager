# Fantasy App Frontend

This is the frontend of the Fantasy App, built with **React**, **Redux Toolkit**, and **Material-UI**. The app allows users to manage their fantasy teams, list players for transfer, and interact with the transfer market.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Login and registration in a single flow.
- **Team Management:** View and manage your team, including listing and unlisting players for transfers.
- **Transfer Market:** Search for players by team name, player name, or price, and buy players from other teams.
- **Responsive Design:** Built using Material-UI for consistent and mobile-friendly design.
- **State Management:** Utilizes Redux Toolkit for efficient global state management.
- **Notifications:** Displays error and success messages with react-toastify.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

## Getting Started

**Clone the repository:**

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/fantasy-app-frontend.git

# Install Dependines

npm install

# Start front end

npm start

# Browser

App will run on http://localhost:3000

# Node version

v20.11.1

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
